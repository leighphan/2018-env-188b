##### Lesson adapted from csoderberg OSF-Curriculum https://github.com/csoderberg/OSF-Curriculum

## Take-aways

We covered a lot of information today.

Reproducible research practices aren’t all or nothing. Even small improvements to organization and documentation can help increase the transparency and reproducibility of research.

Some people will make a full workflow overhaul straight out of the gate, others will make a series of small, incremental changes to their research processes. Both of these approaches are fine, it’s all about what works best to integrating reproducible practices into your own workflow.

Figuring out how to apply examples to your particular needs can be challenging. So, before I open it up to questions and discussion here is where you can get help after this workshop.
