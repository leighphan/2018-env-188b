## Documenting Data Modifications

This section is broken down into three sections:

1. **Data manipulation**
1. **Literate programming**
1. **Explore a working knitr document**

> ## 1. Documenting data modifications
>
> - Distinguish between a spreadsheet formatted properly for later analysis in `R` and one formatted improperly.
> - Be able to recognize common data entry errors and how to handle them.
> - Be able to describe the concept of 'raw data' and why it is important.
> - Differentiate between manual and programmatic file manipulation and know the pros and cons of each.

### Activity 1

Please download the Excel file called [`oceania_uk.xlsx`]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/prog-mod/oceania-uk.xlsx) and open it.

Depending on what type of science you do, data may come from instruments, online databases, or transcribed from field or lab notebooks into spreadsheets. Thinking about how to format your data in those spreadsheets to ensure that it is machine readable (that is, easily parseable by an algorithm or script) and well documented for humans is important.

In `R`, the primary data type used most often is called a data frame. Although there are many similarities to the ways datasets are represented in spreadsheet programs, there are a few key differences and formatting concerns. This exercise works through "fixing" a poorly-formatted spreadsheet in Excel and preparing it for use in R. Along the way, we will also work to create supplementary documentation and move everything to plain text formats.

**Instructions**

Assume for the moment that this is your only copy of the data. it's important **NEVER** to modify by hand or by script your only copy of a dataset, since you may need to start over at some point in the future. Therefore, before making any corrections to the dataset, remember to create a copy of the file.

Next, once you've duplicated that file, open the copy and start going though the spreadsheet and correct any errors you observe. Every time you find an error and correct it, document exactly what you did, step by step, in a text file. Imagine that you are writing these instructions to yourself or to a colleague to document exactly what you did to this file, so that you could read the file and easily repeat the changes on the original copy if you needed to.

**Textual documentation to executable documentation**

Eventually, all modifications to data files would be done programmatically -- that is, completely through a scripted approach instead of by hand in a graphical user interface (GUI) such as Excel. This skill takes time to learn and to get efficient with. Initially, it may take much longer than doing it by hand, but if the modifications need to be not only recounted later but re-executed, the scripted approach will start to pay off. Importantly, it is natural to extend the script approach to include automatic tests to verify that the dataset (which may changed since last time you inspected it) meets the basic integrity constraints that are assumed. AND you now have a fully documented and reproducible set of instructions for cleaning your data.
